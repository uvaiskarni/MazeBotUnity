# MazeBotUnity
Open AI PPO algorithm based maze traverser developed and implemented in UNITY 3D 

In this project we solved a simple maze game wherein the agent was trained to find the shortest path towards the target with minimal collisions with the walls and the obstacles. Unity 3D - a game development platform is used for creating a maze-like environment. ML-agents toolkit, an open-source Unity project is used, which enables the training of the intelligent agents using reinforcement learning or any machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API.

Then different features of the Unity were utilized to analyze and monitor the performance of the policy optimization e.g. multiple environment spaces were built, creating replicas of the same environment to monitor the speed of convergence while parallel training, played with the Curriculum learning, shaping the rewards i.e. finding the right amount of reward that needs to be assigned for each state-action pair, tweaking the parameters for Ray-perception 3D sensor for the agent and finally gathering the results and analyze the training statistics with the plots
